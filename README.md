# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Welcome to my repository on **Data Structures and Algorithms** implemented in Python! This repository contains notes, explanations, and sample code for various data structures and algorithms that I have learned and practiced. Each file in this repository is dedicated to a specific topic, with detailed explanations and Python code examples.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning resource for **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. As I work through different concepts, I will add detailed notes and Python code implementations. Each file typically includes:

- A brief explanation of the data structure or algorithm.
- Code implementation in Python.
- Example usage and edge cases.

### Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored non-contiguously. Each node contains a reference to the next node.

- **Note & Code**: [linked_list.py](./linked_list.py)

### Stacks
Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. They are used in algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) and for expression evaluation.

- **Note & Code**: [stack.py](./stacks_and_queues.py.py)

### Queues
Queues use the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. They are useful in scenarios like scheduling tasks or managing requests.

- **Note & Code**: [queue.py](./stacks_and_queues.py.py)
